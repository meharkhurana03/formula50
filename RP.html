        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Their first full season under new owners – led by Canadian businessman Lawrence Stroll, father of racer Lance – may have been a tough one, but a bright future beckons for the Silverstone-based squad. Race winners in their original guise of Jordan, and a midfield force as Force India, they are well renowned for their ability to punch above their weight. Add in renewed financial stability, a stable driver line-up, and a new factory in the works, and Racing Point are very much a team to watch in 2020.</p>
